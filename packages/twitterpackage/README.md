# TwitterPackage

**A Simple Twitter Feed Rretriever**

This TwitterPackage provides users the functionality of inputting a twitter username and returning a desired number of recent tweets. Twitter retrieval is done through [twit](https://github.com/ttezel/twit).

## How to use

All the functionality is included within the package. OAuth authentication keys need to be provided by the user in order to receive access to the twitter API. This can be done by inputting the neccesary keys into the "keys" field within twitterpackage.js.
